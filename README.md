# eCommerce Data Pipeline

Short: extraction -> cleaning -> load to BigQuery -> SQL analysis -> RFM -> Looker Studio dashboards.

Files:
- scripts/ (etl scripts)
- notebooks/ (cleaning, RFM)
- data/samples/ (small sample CSVs)
- docs/ (dashboard screenshots)

(Replace placeholders later: BigQuery project, Looker link)
